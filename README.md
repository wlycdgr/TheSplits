# THE SPLITS

The Splits is a collection of original action game design specifications. 

Windows installers, builds of example implementations are provided, and/or links to the example implementation source repos are provided. Andbut it should be straightforward to implement your own versions directly from the specs, particularly so if you're working on a platform that supports controller input. 

[My GameMaker Studio 2 template](https://github.com/wlycdgrfromflatiron/GMS-Splitslib) can help you get started. It provides a UI framework, an animated font, input handling, and a simple state machine, and should allow you to jump more or less straight into designing and implementing you core mechanics ideas.

This repo and all the sample implementations are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE). You are free to do pretty much whatever you want with the specs and source code.
