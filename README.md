# THE SPLITS

The Splits is a collection of original action game design specifications. 

Windows installers and/or builds of example implementations are provided, as well as links to the source repositories of those implementations. Andbut it should be straightforward to implement your own versions directly from the specs, particularly so if you're working on a platform that supports controller input. A link to a GameMaker template repo is provided to help you get started.

This repo and all the sample implementations are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE). You are free to do pretty much whatever you want with the specs and source code.
