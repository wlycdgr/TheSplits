# THE SPLITS

The Splits is a collection of original action game design specifications. 

Links to example implementation source repos are provided in the specs. Andbut it should be straightforward to implement your own versions directly from the specs, particularly so if you're working on a platform that supports controller input.

[My GameMaker Studio 2 template](https://github.com/wlycdgrfromflatiron/GMS-Splitslib) can help you get started. It provides a UI framework, an animated font, input handling, and a simple state machine, and should allow you to jump more or less straight into designing and implementing you core mechanics ideas.
