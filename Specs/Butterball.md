# BUTTERBALL

Players control two avatars simultaneously. If the avatars touch the game is over.

The first avatar is controlled with the left analog stick. Its position is a scaled representation of how far and in which direction the player is pushing that analog stick. Think gamepad calibration software.

The left analog stick also moves the second avatar, in the more traditional way where the position of the analog stick determines the avatar's velocity rather than its position.

The second avatar has a turret which the player can aim with the right analog stick. The bullets may interact with playfield obstacles/boundaries, the avatars, and any targets/enemies that may be present.
