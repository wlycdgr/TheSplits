# LUXURIOUS CROSSHAIR

Players control two avatars simultaneously. In the example implementation, one avatar is controlled with the left analog stick, and the other with the right. If the avatars touch the game is over.

A line extends from each avatar. The player can rotate each line clockwise and/or counterclockwise; in the example implementation, this is done by applying variable pressure on the gamepad triggers.

Something happens at the intersection of the two lines.
