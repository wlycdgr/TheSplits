# NO PRESSURE

Players control two avatars simultaneously. If the avatars touch the game is over.

One or both avatars may fire some kind of projectile. Each avatar serves as the other's reticle.

The avatars are inside a bounded playfield, and if the avatars touch the boundaries the game is over. The walls of the playfield close in over time.
